/**
 * Content-Security-Policy.
 *
 * Motivation is clickjacking, not XSS: /facilitator/[roomId] renders one-click
 * destructive controls — "Run selector", "Close room" (purges every real
 * name), and deleteRoom (hard delete, FK cascade). SameSite=Lax does NOT
 * prevent framing, and the room UUID an attacker needs is visible on any
 * projection URL. A transparent iframe over a decoy gets a logged-in
 * facilitator to click through a deletion or a mid-session purge.
 *
 * Directive notes:
 *  - style-src 'unsafe-inline': Tailwind 4 and Next both emit inline styles.
 *  - img-src data:: the join QR is rendered as a data: URL (`lib/qr.ts`).
 *  - connect-src *.supabase.co + wss://*.supabase.co: phones talk to Supabase
 *    DIRECTLY for PostgREST reads and Realtime — the Worker does not proxy
 *    them. Get this wrong and Realtime dies silently, which presents as "the
 *    room just stopped updating", not as an error.
 *  - frame-ancestors 'none' + X-Frame-Options: DENY: the actual fix.

/**
 * REPORT-ONLY for now — deliberate, do not flip without checking.
 *
 * Enforcing this policy as written WILL break the app: it has no `script-src`,
 * so `default-src 'self'` applies to scripts, and the Next App Router serves
 * its hydration payload through INLINE <script> tags (`self.__next_f.push`).
 * Those are blocked by 'self' alone, and the result is a page that renders and
 * then never becomes interactive.
 *
 * Report-only first therefore does two jobs: it confirms the Supabase
 * connect-src is right (Realtime keeps working), and it surfaces the inline
 * script violations so the fix is chosen with evidence rather than guessed.
 *
 * To enforce later, do BOTH:
 *   1. Add a script-src that permits Next's inline bootstrap. Either
 *      `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` (simple, weaker), or a per-request
 *      nonce injected via `src/proxy.ts` with `'strict-dynamic'` (correct,
 *      more moving parts — note the proxy matcher currently covers only
 *      /facilitator and would have to widen to every route).
 *   2. Flip CSP_HEADER to "Content-Security-Policy".
 *
 * The clickjacking protection does NOT wait for that: X-Frame-Options: DENY
 * below is enforced immediately and closes the framing attack on its own.
