 * Per-room participant identity cookie — the "you already have a seat" guard.
 *
 * Set (httpOnly, signed) when a participant joins a room; read by `joinRoom`
 * so re-opening the join link returns the SAME participant instead of
 * inserting a duplicate. Survives sessionStorage loss (new tab, browser
 * restart) for the cookie's lifetime.
 *
 * Signed with `PARTICIPANT_COOKIE_SECRET` — deliberately NOT the same key as
 * the facilitator session — and stamped with `iss`/`aud`. See
 * `tokenSecrets.ts`: a rotation of the old shared secret silently broke every
 * seat cookie, which made `joinRoom` skip its duplicate-join guard and double
 * the roster.
