/**
 * Base URL for absolute links (join URLs, QR payloads).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SECURITY-SENSITIVE: the value returned here is what the
 * projection screen encodes into the QR code participants scan
 * (`screen/[roomId]/page.tsx`). A forged `x-forwarded-host` therefore yields
 * a projected QR pointing at an attacker's clone of the join page, which
 * harvests exactly what that form asks for — real names. The Vercel origin is
 * directly reachable, so the Worker cannot be relied on to pin the header.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` — the explicit, trusted answer. Set this in
 *      production; it makes the request headers irrelevant.
 *   2. A request host that appears in the allow-list below.
 *   3. Localhost, in development only.
 *
 * Anything else throws rather than emitting an attacker-controlled URL. A
 * broken QR that fails loudly is strictly better than a working QR that
 * points somewhere hostile.
 *
 * Server only.
