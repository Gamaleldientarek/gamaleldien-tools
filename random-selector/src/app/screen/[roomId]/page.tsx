/**
 * /screen/[roomId] — PROJECTION view (16:9, legible at 3-5m).
 *
 * No login friction on the room display. The server fetches the initial room
 * + sanitized roster (safe columns only — never real_name), mints the scoped
 * room JWT, and renders the real join QR; the client component takes over
 * with Realtime.
 *
 * THE roomId IS NOT A CAPABILITY — do not build on the assumption that it is.
 * This comment used to claim "the unguessable roomId uuid is the capability",
 * and that is false in practice: /join/[code] is unauthenticated and embeds
 * room.id in the rendered page, so anyone who guesses or reads a room CODE is
 * one request away from the uuid. This route is effectively public, and it
 * mints the caller a 4h room-scoped JWT granting direct PostgREST and
 * Realtime reads.
 *
 * What that exposes is the SANITIZED roster — display names, join numbers,
 * draw order. NOT real names: the column-scoped grant in 0003_rls.sql keeps
 * `real_name` away from anon entirely, in Postgres rather than in TypeScript.
 * So the exposure here is session metadata, not PII, and that is a deliberate
 * accepted trade for a projection screen nobody should have to log into.
 *
 * If that trade ever stops being acceptable, add a real gate here — do not
 * reach for the uuid's unguessability, because it does not hold.
